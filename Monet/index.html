    <header id="header">"Monet demonstrated that no absolute colour
        exists in Nature, only light; and that since the appearance of all objects changes perpetually, the
        art of the painter should consist in choosing one moment in preference to any other, in order to
        fix its individuality in a definitive image." - Dictionary of Modern Painting, pg.196</header>

        About the painter: Claude Monet was a French painter who lived from 1840-1926. He was notable for his 
        influence on and role in the impressionism movement along with his contemporaries such as Van Gogh and Ã‰douard Manet.
        As the quote suggests, his exceptional paintings captured color not as a defined property but as a result of the light in a scene.
        Coupled with brush strokes melting together seen in impressionism, Monet's portrayal of light captures the beauty of the world.
