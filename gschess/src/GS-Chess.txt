Grand Strategy Chess.

Goal: a simple grand strategy game that just uses existing chess pieces in unique ways with more ground and more focus trees. 

2 player or 4 player (don't worry about AI until very end (or not at all).

Start:
1. Chess pieces have normal movement and you start with normal setup
2. move 4 pieces per turn
3. Kill all enemy kings to win

2pl Board: 32 x 48
4pl: ???
- no obstacles unless extra mode

Extra Rules: (limit bc chess)
- king can produce pieces at any square around it. Takes certain turn #. 
pawn: 1
bishop: 3
rook: 3
knight: 4
queen: 6
king: 7
- if no avail square, just stays queued until next turn
- production does not count as a move
- that's it :)

Focus trees:
- modes for same & different 
- different just has an extra branch for each.
- Each focus takes a certain number of turns

Paths:

<1,000 Eyes>
+4 pawns
<Night Crawler> | <Holy Wars>
+1 Knights or +2 bishops
<Crazy Train> 
+2 rooks
<Schism> | <The Four Horsemen>
+4 bishops   or  +4 knights

<Production>
make king now 6 turns
<B>  & <K>  & <R>
all -1 for associated piece (pick 2)
<Polygamy>   |   <Duopoly>
free queen OR free king (mut. excl)
<B>  |  <K>  |  <R>
-1 for associated pieces  (m.e.)
<Triumverate> | <Q> 
free king or queen to 5
<Royal Industry>
king to 6

<Advance>
Pawn first move forward twice
<Shining Armor>
Knights can double move on spawn
<Quick Deployment> | <Pawn Offensive> | <Mass Deployment>
 +1 move for any piece on any spawn, / Pawns can now attack in front, / option for 4 pawns in 3 turns
<Fast Pawns>
Pawns can now move 2 squares ahead at a time

â˜† balance it a with time[num turns] per upgrade

Commentary:
- kings can move and spawn to encourage supplying from dif angles. Act more as supply hubs than rulers.
- pawns can still change to any piece at board end :)

IMPLEMENTATION: don't worry about it until/ unless you restart the project with better tools and knowledge.
- but would check if bishop move possible by abs(x - new x) == abs (y - new y);, then check conflicts

Scrapping this project for now. Might try again but make it less chess-like later?
