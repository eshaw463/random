Idea: 

Maybe I can have it be a war between rovers for resources on the moon to extract and give back to alien empires so its just a really confusing grand stategy game.
- You get resources with individual bots and make factories and build things & extract still BUT
- you also cycle between different rovers and new types of rovers and work around obstacles, etc and work to defeat your opponent.
- I kind of want to make it intentionally difficult to track bc you're controlling indavidual rovers lol but still
	- how combat? should probably be simple as in collision with some numbers lol


Teams: I'll find some nice colors or let the player pick.
rovers: start with 3, 24 maximum 		; too many bots would make it just not fun to control indavidually
movment: have a number of points to use per turn depending on rovers; switch between them with some text command; display which rover and its info in a small hud
	;can have an help command with list of commands; info command for each rover (can make cool hacker-y visuals for level or equipment lol)

* I'm going to start very simple with 1 resource, easy command to make bots, and uniform movment per turn, also collision attack will be a 50/50 for now
can make it WAY more fun than just make bots and spam them AFTER I get the basics down


also I don't have to sleep tonight until I figure out the basics bc I don't have classes lol.
start it as a visually pleasing but simple terminal game ig lol
